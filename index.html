            <p class="large-text">The Kibble Palace is a magnificent 19th-century glasshouse covering 2,137m² in Glasgow
              Botanic Gardens – publicly-owned gardens managed by Glasgow City Council.</p>

            <p>This architectural marvel, constructed from curved wrought iron and glass supported by cast-iron beams,
              initially served as an exhibition venue before transitioning to house plants in the 1880s. Today, it
              contains a remarkable collection of flora including the national collection of Australasian tree ferns.

        <p>As one of Glasgow's most popular tourist attractions, the Kibble Palace welcomes visitors from around the
          world while serving as a beloved space for local residents. However, Glasgow City Council faces a significant
          challenge in effectively measuring visitor footfall to make informed decisions about resource allocation,
          staffing, and long-term planning.</p>

            <p class="large-text">Glasgow City Council struggles to accurately measure visitor numbers at the Kibble
              Palace, creating barriers to effective facility management.</p>

            <p><strong>Resource Planning:</strong> Without accurate visitor data, it's difficult to optimize staffing
              levels and understand seasonal patterns that could inform better resource allocation.</p>

            <p><strong>Heritage Constraints:</strong> The building's Category A Listed status severely limits
              technological solutions, requiring approaches that avoid any structural modifications while preserving the
              building's historic integrity.</p>

            <p><strong>Visitor Experience:</strong> Any solution must remain completely unobtrusive to maintain the
              serene, heritage atmosphere that visitors expect when exploring this historic glasshouse.</p>
