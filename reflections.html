            <h3>Insights from Client Meetings</h3>
            <p class="large-text">Our discussions with the Friends of Glasgow Botanic Gardens revealed crucial insights
              that shaped our entire approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Privacy and Discretion:</strong> They value discretion and privacy more than flashy tech. This
              insight led us to prioritize anonymous counting methods and reject any camera-based solutions that might
              make visitors uncomfortable.</p>

            <p><strong>Heritage Sensitivity:</strong> Budget and listed building status drive every decision. We learned
              that even the most innovative solution is worthless if it can't be implemented within the strict heritage
              guidelines that protect the Kibble Palace's historical integrity.</p>

            <h3>What We Learned from Prototyping</h3>
            <p class="large-text">The prototyping process revealed both technical challenges and design opportunities we
              hadn't initially considered.</p>

            <p><strong>Directional Accuracy:</strong> Our initial solution lacked the capability to track direction of
              footfall, resulting in high inaccuracy. This discovery led us to develop the dual-sensor approach that
              became central to our final design.</p>

            <p><strong>Real-world Constraints:</strong> Sketching the flow revealed practical constraints (e.g., group
              entries, line-of-sight) that we hadn't anticipated in our initial concepts.</p>

            <p><strong>Rapid Iteration:</strong> Paper prototyping allowed for quick sketches to be made, avoiding
              costly mistakes in the digital implementation phase. This approach helped us test multiple concepts
              quickly and identify the most promising directions.</p>
