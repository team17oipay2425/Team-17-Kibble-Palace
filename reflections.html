              <h3>Privacy and Discretion</h3>
              <p>They value discretion and privacy more than flashy tech. This insight led us to prioritize anonymous
                counting methods and reject any camera-based solutions that might make visitors uncomfortable.</p>

              <p>Budget and listed building status drive every decision. We learned that even the most innovative
                solution is worthless if it can't be implemented within the strict heritage guidelines that protect the
                Kibble Palace's historical integrity.</p>

          <h2>What We Learned from Prototyping</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">The prototyping process revealed both technical challenges and design opportunities
            we hadn't initially considered.</p>

          <div class="insights-flow">
            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Directional Accuracy</h3>
              <p>Our initial solution lacked the capability to track direction of footfall, resulting in high
                inaccuracy. This discovery led us to develop the dual-sensor approach that became central to our final
                design.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Real-world Constraints</h3>
              <p>Sketching the flow revealed practical constraints (e.g., group entries, line-of-sight) that we hadn't
                anticipated in our initial concepts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Rapid Iteration</h3>
              <p>Paper prototyping allowed for quick sketches to be made, avoiding costly mistakes in the digital
                implementation phase. This approach helped us test multiple concepts quickly and identify the most
                promising directions.</p>
