              <h3>Privacy and Discretion</h3>
              <p>They value discretion and privacy more than flashy tech. This insight led us to prioritize anonymous
                counting methods and reject any camera-based solutions that might make visitors uncomfortable.</p>

              <p>Budget and listed building status drive every decision. We learned that even the most innovative
                solution is worthless if it can't be implemented within the strict heritage guidelines that protect the
                Kibble Palace's historical integrity.</p>

          <h2>What We Learned from Prototyping</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">The prototyping process revealed both technical challenges and design opportunities
            we hadn't initially considered.</p>

          <div class="insights-flow">
            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Directional Accuracy</h3>
              <p>Our initial solution lacked the capability to track direction of footfall, resulting in high
                inaccuracy. This discovery led us to develop the dual-sensor approach that became central to our final
                design.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Real-world Constraints</h3>
              <p>Sketching the flow revealed practical constraints (e.g., group entries, line-of-sight) that we hadn't
                anticipated in our initial concepts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Rapid Iteration</h3>
              <p>Paper prototyping allowed for quick sketches to be made, avoiding costly mistakes in the digital
                implementation phase. This approach helped us test multiple concepts quickly and identify the most
                promising directions.</p>

          <h2>Reflections from Visitors</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">Direct feedback from Kibble Palace visitors provided invaluable insights that shaped
            our user-centred approach.</p>

          <div class="insights-flow">
            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Awareness Gap</h3>
              <p>Most visitors assumed footfall tracking was already in place and were surprised to learn the data was
                outdated. This validated our problem statement and highlighted the importance of invisible, seamless
                solutions that don't disrupt the visitor experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Privacy Acceptance</h3>
              <p>Visitors were generally supportive of anonymous tracking if it helped improve facility management,
                especially when assured it wouldn't affect the free entry policy. This gave us confidence in our
                privacy-first approach using IR sensors rather than cameras.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Incentive Requirements</h3>
              <p>Initial feedback showed visitors lacked motivation to scan QR codes without personal benefit. This led
                us to integrate educational content and interesting facts about Kibble Palace into the form,
                transforming data collection into a value-added experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Information Needs</h3>
              <p>Visitors expressed interest in knowing about peak times and event impacts to avoid crowds. This
                feedback influenced our dashboard design to include public-facing features that could benefit both staff
                operations and visitor planning.</p>

              <h3>Heritage-Sensitive Innovation</h3>
              <p>We successfully balanced cutting-edge technology with heritage preservation requirements. Our solution
                respects the Category A Listed status while providing modern functionality, proving that innovation
                doesn't require compromising historical integrity.</p>

            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>User-Centred Design Process</h3>
              <p>From stakeholder interviews to visitor feedback sessions, we consistently prioritized real user needs
                over technical sophistication. Our iterative approach resulted in a solution that addresses actual
                operational challenges rather than perceived problems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Privacy-First Approach</h3>
              <p>In an era of increasing surveillance concerns, we designed a system that collects valuable data while
                maintaining complete visitor anonymity. Our dual-sensor approach proves that effective monitoring
                doesn't require personal data collection.</p>

                can actually implement. We're proud that our design isn't just conceptually sound but practically
                achievable.</p>

            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Group Counting Challenges</h3>
              <p>Large groups entering simultaneously may cause timing challenges for our dual-sensor logic. While our
                testing achieved high accuracy, very crowded conditions (school groups, special events) might require
                additional calibration or supplementary counting methods.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>QR Code Adoption Rates</h3>
              <p>Despite our improvements to incentivize QR code scanning, demographic data collection remains voluntary
                and may have limited participation rates. This could result in incomplete demographic insights,
                potentially skewing country-of-origin data.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Maintenance Requirements</h3>
              <p>Battery-powered sensors require periodic maintenance and replacement. While this avoids electrical
                work, it creates ongoing operational responsibilities that need to be factored into long-term planning
                and budgets.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-point">
              <h3>Limited Behavioural Insights</h3>
              <p>Our privacy-first approach, while ethically sound, limits deeper behavioural analytics. The system
                counts entries/exits but doesn't track visitor paths, dwell times, or interaction patterns that could
                provide additional operational insights.</p>
