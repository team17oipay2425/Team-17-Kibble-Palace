          <p>We're a group of student designers and developers focused on creating meaningful, low-cost solutions for
            real-world problems. Our diverse backgrounds in engineering, design, and technology allow us to approach
            challenges from multiple perspectives.</p>

          <p><strong>Our Mission:</strong><br>To deliver an accurate, user-centered footfall tracking system that
            respects the heritage and design of the Kibble Palace while providing valuable insights for facility
            management.</p>

          <p>Throughout this project, we've learned the importance of balancing technological innovation with heritage
            preservation, ensuring that our solutions enhance rather than compromise the historical significance of this
            magnificent Victorian glasshouse.</p>
