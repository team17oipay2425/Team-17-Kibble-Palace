              <h4>Day 1 - Stakeholder Meeting</h4>
              <p>
                On our first day of lecture, the biggest takeaway from Prof. Alaistar was how the way we ask questions
                about
                our solution can shape the outcome of our design. Although the team has prepared questions to ask the
                client
                during our first meeting, we found that the questions were lacking during the team activity conducted
                during
                the lecture with another team and thus improved on it before our stakeholder meeting in the afternoon.
                Overall,
                this was a key insight that we carried into our stakeholder meeting with Chrissy from Friends of Glasgow
                Botanic Gardens.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the afternoon we held our first stakeholder meeting where we met with Chrissy from Friends of Glasgow
                Botanic Gardens,
                who provided insights into footfall tracking in the Kibble Palace. She explained the daily operational
                challenges: with staff
                struggling to justify resource allocation without concrete visitor data and a distinct lack of usage
                statistics resulting in weakening funding applications. Through this meeting, we now had an insight on
                the challenges of accurate footfall counting in a listed building with limited budget and strict
                modification rules. We also learnt what was the methodology previously used to track footfall up till
                2016 which was:
                <li>Manual counting by staff, which was time-consuming and prone to errors.</li>
                <li>Location pinging using mobile devices carried by visitors, which was inaccurate.</li>
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the client has also highlighted three key priorities for the solution:
                <li>Budget Friendly: The cost of the proposed/implemented solution should be as low as zero</li>
                <li>Accurate: The accuracy of the data recorded using the proposed solution should be as accurate as
                  possible</li>
                <li>Compliance with Regulation: The implemented solution should not alter the building appearance in any
                  way and
                  should be invisible to visitors if possible</li>
              <p>
                Key insights from the meeting: Any solution must be invisible to visitors, along with no structural
                modifications to the building. Budget constraints are also a significant factor, as well as ensuring
                that the plants remain unaffected.

              <h4>Day 2 - Initial Research</h4>
              <p>
                On Day 2, we began to brainstorm potential solutions to the footfall tracking problem. As we discussed
                with the client the day before,
                we learnt that no existing solutions were in place. This led us to explore various existing footfall
                tracking solutions and
                their limitations across similar attractions with one such example being Singapore Botanic Gardens.
                While there's no concrete evidence of a footfall tracking system at Singapore Botanic Gardens, we
                discovered that they likely
                use a combination of voluntary visitor surveys and strategically placed sensors to estimate visitor
                numbers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, we also explored other technical approaches to footfall tracking such as:
                <li>Thermal imaging and pressure plates - both were dismissed due to high costs, especially pressure
                  plate installation.</li>
                <li>Computer Vision - ruled out due to technical complexity and privacy concerns.</li>

              </p>
              <p>
                We eventually settled on an IR sensor approach, which would be cost-effective and easy to
                install without modifying the building structure. The system would allow us to discreetly count foot
                traffic
                using discreet IR sensors placed at the entrance, ensuring minimal disruption to the visitor experience.
              </p>

            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 3 - Ideation Sketches</h4>
              <p>
                On Day 3, we focused on sketching out our initial ideas for the IR sensor system. We discussed how
                the sensors would be positioned at the entrance to accurately count foot traffic without being
                intrusive.
                The sketches included the sensor placement and anticipated visitor movement patterns, as well as how the
                data
                would be collected and processed
              </p>
              <p>
                After settling on our solution, we started out by creating a lo-fi prototype of using a single IR sensor
                system. This process allowed us to visualise the limitations of our initial design utilising just 1
                sensor.
                We quickly realised that a single sensor would not be sufficient to accurately count foot traffic, as
                it could not distinguish between entries and exits. We then explored the idea of using two sensors
                placed in sequence, which would allow us to determine the direction of movement and accurately count
                foot traffic. We also sketched potential dashboard layouts and discussed data visualization
                requirements.

              <h4>Day 4 - Reflecting on Client Insights and Prototyping</h4>
              <p>For day 4, we developed and recorded our first pitch video to communicate our initial solution for
                footfall
                tracking at the Kibble Palace. This process pushed us to organise our ideas clearly and reflect more
                deeply on
                our design decisions so far.
              </p>
              <p>While structuring the video, we revisited our client interviews and re-evaluated our assumptions.
                Initially, we
                assumed that a high-tech system was expected from us, however our client emphasised that their budget
                constraints and
                listed building status made it difficult to pursue that route.
              </p>
              <p>From a design perspective, this phase helped us move beyond abstract ideation into tangible planning:
                <li>We began defining key requirements: low-cost, non-intrusive and data privacy friendly.</li>
                <li>We outlined a basic prototype on paper involving dual sensor logic, and introduced the idea of an
                  optional
                  QR code form for demographic insights.
                </li>
              </p>
              <p>Producing the pitch also highlighted key gaps in our early design. For example while our idea was
                technically viable,
                we hadn't yet addressed how the system would process and visualise the data. Such issues were flagged
                during team discussions
                and would guide our prototyping in the coming days.
              </p>
              <p>Finally, the act of visualising the solution through paper sketches helped us communicate the concept
                more clearly. Reinforcing
                our understanding that good design requires functional logic and accessible storytelling.

            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 5 - Dashboard Prototyping</h4>
              <p>We focused on designing the dashboard interface for the staff use. Based on the client meeting and
                understanding of their needs, we prioritized features like real-time visitor counts, daily patterns, and
                historical data visualization. We created wireframes for different dashboard views: real-time occupancy
                display showing current visitor counts, daily summary charts tracking hourly patterns, weekly trend
                analysis for operational planning, and monthly reports suitable for council presentations and funding
                applications. </p>
              <p>We designed the interface to show key metrics at a glance, as well as specialized sections for deeper
                insights: visitor trends showing daily patterns, country of origin data, as well as event tracking with
                attendance figures, helping staff to understand which programs drive the most engagement</p>
              <p>At first, there was some struggles with balancing comprehensive data presentation while still retaining
                visual clarity. We eventually settled on a clean, spacious layout with large fonts and intuitive color
                coding, making it easier for staff to digest the information quickly which still providing the detailed
                analytics needed for strategic planning and reporting.</p>

            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 6 - Interviewing Visitors of Kibble Palace</h4>
              <p>Today, we visited Kibble Palace to gather feedback from actual visitors about their awareness and
                thoughts
                on footfall tracking. Surprisingly, many assumed that there was already a tracking system in place and
                were
                unaware that the data was outdated.</p>
              <p>Most visitors were open to the idea of anonymous tracking if it can help improve the management of the
                place,
                especially if it preserves the free entry policy. We explained our concept (IR sensors + QR code form)
                and the feedback
                we got was positive provided it remained non-intrusive and didn't feel like surveillance. However, they
                also highlighted
                that they would not be incentivised to scan the QR code form as it did not benefit their visit to the
                Kibble Palace.</p>
              <p>We also showed them our basic dashboard wireframe to gain some insights on what kind of data visitors
                would like to see.
                It was highlighted to us that while the simple nature of our dashboard did not provide enough insights
                into information that
                visitors would want to know about. They mentioned information like how events impact the number of
                people at Kibble Palace would
                be good to know so they can avoid busy periods.

            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 7 - Improving QR Code Form and Dashboard Prototypes</h4>
              <p>Following the feedback we received from visitors during our interviews at Kibble Palace, we made
                several
                improvements to our prototype to enhance user engagement and data utility.</p>
              <p>Based on the interviews we did yesterday, we made several improvements to the dashboard and QR code
                form.</p>
              <p>QR Code Form improvements, many visitors indicated they lacked incentive to complete it. To address
                this:
                <li>Added a section that displays fun and lesser-known facts about Kibble Palace after submission</li>
              </p>
              <p>On the dashboard side, we integrated new features to make the data more insightful for stakeholders.
                These includes:
                <li>Added weather impacts to visitor numbers.</li>
                <li>Added events and their respective visitor counts.</li>
                <li>Show weekly and monthly visitor counts.</li>
              <p>These changes were designed to provide clearer, more actionable insights to inform future decisions.
              </p>
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 8 - Development of Cardboard Prototype </h4>
              <p>Today, we built a physical cardboard prototype to better simulate the traffic flow of Kibble Palace.
                The goal was to
                better visualise how visitors enter, move through, and exit the area especially during busier times
                where there are events.
              </p>
              <p>The prototype included:
                <li>Two entry/exit points with labelled sensor positions (A and B).</li>
                <li>A model layout of the palace entrance/exit to simulate real visitor movement.</li>
                <li>Cardboard cut-outs to represent visitors.</li>
              </p>
              <p>Using this, we tested how visitors might unintentionally walk side-by-side or in reverse directions,
                and how that could affect
                our dual sensor logic. It helped us confirm the following:
                <li>Dual sensors are necessary to detect direction.</li>
                <li>Crowd density or group entry may cause timing challenges for logging.</li>
                <li>Placement height and angle may impact accuracy.</li>
              </p>
              <p>Top-down and POV video footage was recorded during prototyping to show how we simulated visitor flow.

              <h4>Day 9 - Reflecting on Visitor Interview Insights and Prototyping</h4>
              <p>Pitch video 2 was due today, so we used our remaining time to do the final reflections on our full
                journey, from early assumptions
                to user feedback and iterative prototyping. Key reflection points included:
                <li>Visitors were generally unaware of the outdated footfall tracking, which validated our problem
                  framing.</li>
                <li>Interview feedback helped us refine our QR form and dashboard insights.</li>
              </p>
              <p>By gathering feedback from real users, we were able to further improve our QR form to make it more
                appealing for visitors to
                scan and contribute to the demographic tracking, while ensuring their privacy isn't breached.
              </p>
              <p>Final edits to the video focused on showcasing the evolution of our prototyping, not just what we
                built, but why we built it that way.</p>

              <h4>Day 10 - Partner feedback meeting</h4>
              <p>Today, we met with our partner to discuss the latest stage of our prototype. The session focused on
                clarifying how our system works and why we made certain design choices.
              </p>
              <p>One key question raised was:
                <br>"Why not just use one sensor on the door where everyone passes through, wouldn't that be cheaper?"
                <br>We explained that while one sensor could track movement, it would not be able to determine
                direction. Using
                a dual sensor setup allows us to identify whether someone is entering or exiting, which is critical for
                accurate
                footfall counting, especially in a free-flow space like in the Kibble Palace. It also reduces the risk
                of miscounting
                during crowded moments, such as events or school group visits.
              </p>
              <p>Another question was:
                <br>"How does the system distinguish entry from exit?"
                <br>We explained that the two sensors would be placed in sequence. If Sensor A triggers before Sensor B,
                it's logged
                as an entry. If Sensor B triggers before Sensor A, it's logged as an exit. This simple logic forms the
                core of our
                tracking system and is both cost-effective and privacy-respecting.
              </p>
              <p>This discussion helped reinforce the importance of clearly communicating the logic and benefits of our
                setup. It also
                confirmed that our solution aligns well with the client's goals, accuracy, simplicity and minimal
                disruption to the building.

              <h4>Day 11 - Usability Testing and Poster</h4>
              <p>Day 11 marks the submission of our group poster. Today the team finalised the poster together using
                what was taught during
                the lecture on poster design during Day 9 conducted by Prof. Alistair. The poster was designed to be
                visually appealing,
                informative, and easy to read. We used a clean layout with clear headings, bullet points, and visuals to
                highlight our key findings and design process.
                Furthermore, we also made sure to ensure that the mistakes of posters that Prof. Alistair highlighted
                during the lecture were not repeated in our poster.
                One such example, is ensuring that the poster is not too wordy and the font size is large enough to be
                read from a distance.

                In addition to the poster, we also conducted usability testing on our prototype which can be viewed form
                the video below. We invited a classmate to interact with our figma prototype and
                provide feedback on the user experience. The main feedback we received was that the prototype was
                missing a back button at the end of the form which
                did not allow the user to go back to the previous page. This was a key insight that we took into account
                and made sure to implement in our final prototype.
                the user also pointed out that the use of interesting facts about the Kibble Palace gave them an
                incentive to scan the QR code form to complete the form.
