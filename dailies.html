                <h4>Day 1 - Stakeholder Meeting</h4>
                <p>
                  On our first day of lecture, the biggest takeaway from Prof. Alaistar was how the way we ask questions
                  about our solution can shape the outcome of our design. Although the team has prepared questions to ask the
                  client during our first meeting, we found that the questions were lacking during the team activity conducted
                  during the lecture with another team and thus improved on it before our stakeholder meeting in the afternoon.
                  Overall, this was a key insight that we carried into our stakeholder meeting with Chrissy from Friends of Glasgow
                  Botanic Gardens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the afternoon we held our first stakeholder meeting where we met with Chrissy from Friends of Glasgow
                  Botanic Gardens, who provided insights into footfall tracking in the Kibble Palace. She explained the daily operational
                  challenges: with staff struggling to justify resource allocation without concrete visitor data and a distinct lack of usage
                  statistics resulting in weakening funding applications. Through this meeting, we now had an insight on
                  the challenges of accurate footfall counting in a listed building with limited budget and strict
                  modification rules. We also learnt what was the methodology previously used to track footfall up till
                  2016 which was:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Manual counting by staff, which was time-consuming and prone to errors.</li>
                  <li>Location pinging using mobile devices carried by visitors, which was inaccurate.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, the client has also highlighted three key priorities for the solution:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Budget Friendly: The cost of the proposed/implemented solution should be as low as zero</li>
                  <li>Accurate: The accuracy of the data recorded using the proposed solution should be as accurate as possible</li>
                  <li>Compliance with Regulation: The implemented solution should not alter the building appearance in any way and should be invisible to visitors if possible</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Key insights from the meeting: Any solution must be invisible to visitors, along with no structural
                  modifications to the building. Budget constraints are also a significant factor, as well as ensuring
                  that the plants remain unaffected.

                <h4>Day 2 - Initial Research</h4>
                <p>
                  On Day 2, we began to brainstorm potential solutions to the footfall tracking problem. As we discussed
                  with the client the day before, we learnt that no existing solutions were in place. This led us to explore various existing footfall
                  tracking solutions and their limitations across similar attractions with one such example being Singapore Botanic Gardens.
                  While there's no concrete evidence of a footfall tracking system at Singapore Botanic Gardens, we
                  discovered that they likely use a combination of voluntary visitor surveys and strategically placed sensors to estimate visitor
                  numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, we also explored other technical approaches to footfall tracking such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Thermal imaging and pressure plates - both were dismissed due to high costs, especially pressure plate installation.</li>
                  <li>Computer Vision - ruled out due to technical complexity and privacy concerns.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  We eventually settled on an IR sensor approach, which would be cost-effective and easy to
                  install without modifying the building structure. The system would allow us to discreetly count foot
                  traffic using discreet IR sensors placed at the entrance, ensuring minimal disruption to the visitor experience.

                <h4>Day 3 - Ideation Sketches</h4>
                <p>
                  On Day 3, we focused on sketching out our initial ideas for the IR sensor system. We discussed how
                  the sensors would be positioned at the entrance to accurately count foot traffic without being
                  intrusive. The sketches included the sensor placement and anticipated visitor movement patterns, as well as how the
                  data would be collected and processed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After settling on our solution, we started out by creating a lo-fi prototype of using a single IR sensor
                  system. This process allowed us to visualise the limitations of our initial design utilising just 1
                  sensor. We quickly realised that a single sensor would not be sufficient to accurately count foot traffic, as
                  it could not distinguish between entries and exits. We then explored the idea of using two sensors
                  placed in sequence, which would allow us to determine the direction of movement and accurately count
                  foot traffic. We also sketched potential dashboard layouts and discussed data visualisation
                  requirements.

                <h4>Day 4 - Reflecting on Client Insights and Prototyping</h4>
                <p>For day 4, we developed and recorded our first pitch video to communicate our initial solution for
                  footfall tracking at the Kibble Palace. This process pushed us to organise our ideas clearly and reflect more
                  deeply on our design decisions so far.
                </p>
                <p>While structuring the video, we revisited our client interviews and re-evaluated our assumptions.
                  Initially, we assumed that a high-tech system was expected from us, however our client emphasised that their budget
                  constraints and listed building status made it difficult to pursue that route.
                </p>
                <p>From a design perspective, this phase helped us move beyond abstract ideation into tangible planning:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>We began defining key requirements: low-cost, non-intrusive and data privacy friendly.</li>
                  <li>We outlined a basic prototype on paper involving dual sensor logic, and introduced the idea of an
                    optional QR code form for demographic insights.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Producing the pitch also highlighted key gaps in our early design. For example while our idea was
                  technically viable, we hadn't yet addressed how the system would process and visualise the data. Such issues were flagged
                  during team discussions and would guide our prototyping in the coming days.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, the act of visualising the solution through paper sketches helped us communicate the concept
                  more clearly. Reinforcing our understanding that good design requires functional logic and accessible storytelling.

                <h4>Day 5 - Dashboard Prototyping</h4>
                <p>We focused on designing the dashboard interface for the staff use. Based on the client meeting and
                  understanding of their needs, we prioritised features like real-time visitor counts, daily patterns, and
                  historical data visualisation. We created wireframes for different dashboard views: real-time occupancy
                  display showing current visitor counts, daily summary charts tracking hourly patterns, weekly trend
                  analysis for operational planning, and monthly reports suitable for council presentations and funding
                  applications. </p>
                <p>We designed the interface to show key metrics at a glance, as well as specialised sections for deeper
                  insights: visitor trends showing daily patterns, country of origin data, as well as event tracking with
                  attendance figures, helping staff to understand which programs drive the most engagement</p>
                <p>At first, there was some struggles with balancing comprehensive data presentation while still retaining
                  visual clarity. We eventually settled on a clean, spacious layout with large fonts and intuitive color
                  coding, making it easier for staff to digest the information quickly which still providing the detailed
                  analytics needed for strategic planning and reporting.</p>

                <h4>Day 6 - Interviewing Visitors of Kibble Palace</h4>
                <p>Today, we visited Kibble Palace to gather feedback from actual visitors about their awareness and
                  thoughts on footfall tracking. Surprisingly, many assumed that there was already a tracking system in place and
                  were unaware that the data was outdated.</p>
                <p>Most visitors were open to the idea of anonymous tracking if it can help improve the management of the
                  place, especially if it preserves the free entry policy. We explained our concept (IR sensors + QR code form)
                  and the feedback we got was positive provided it remained non-intrusive and didn't feel like surveillance. However, they
                  also highlighted that they would not be incentivised to scan the QR code form as it did not benefit their visit to the
                  Kibble Palace.</p>
                <p>We also showed them our basic dashboard wireframe to gain some insights on what kind of data visitors
                  would like to see. It was highlighted to us that while the simple nature of our dashboard did not provide enough insights
                  into information that visitors would want to know about. They mentioned information like how events impact the number of
                  people at Kibble Palace would be good to know so they can avoid busy periods.

                <p>Based on the interviews we did yesterday, we made several improvements to the dashboard and QR code
                  form.</p>
                <p>QR Code Form improvements, many visitors indicated they lacked incentive to complete it. To address
                  this:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Added a section that displays fun and lesser-known facts about Kibble Palace after submission</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On the dashboard side, we integrated new features to make the data more insightful for stakeholders.
                  These includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Added weather impacts to visitor numbers.</li>
                  <li>Added events and their respective visitor counts.</li>
                  <li>Show weekly and monthly visitor counts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These changes were designed to provide clearer, more actionable insights to inform future decisions.</p>

                <h4>Day 8 - Development of Cardboard Prototype </h4>
                <p>Today, we built a physical cardboard prototype to better simulate the traffic flow of Kibble Palace.
                  The goal was to better visualise how visitors enter, move through, and exit the area especially during busier times
                  where there are events.
                </p>
                <p>The prototype included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Two entry/exit points with labelled sensor positions (A and B).</li>
                  <li>A model layout of the palace entrance/exit to simulate real visitor movement.</li>
                  <li>Cardboard cut-outs to represent visitors.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using this, we tested how visitors might unintentionally walk side-by-side or in reverse directions,
                  and how that could affect our dual sensor logic. It helped us confirm the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Dual sensors are necessary to detect direction.</li>
                  <li>Crowd density or group entry may cause timing challenges for logging.</li>
                  <li>Placement height and angle may impact accuracy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Top-down and POV video footage was recorded during prototyping to show how we simulated visitor flow.

                <h4>Day 9 - Reflecting on Visitor Interview Insights and Prototyping</h4>
                <p>Pitch video 2 was due today, so we used our remaining time to do the final reflections on our full
                  journey, from early assumptions to user feedback and iterative prototyping. Key reflection points included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Visitors were generally unaware of the outdated footfall tracking, which validated our problem
                    framing.</li>
                  <li>Interview feedback helped us refine our QR form and dashboard insights.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By gathering feedback from real users, we were able to further improve our QR form to make it more
                  appealing for visitors to scan and contribute to the demographic tracking, while ensuring their privacy isn't breached.
                </p>
                <p>Final edits to the video focused on showcasing the evolution of our prototyping, not just what we
                  built, but why we built it that way.</p>

                <h4>Day 10 - Partner feedback meeting</h4>
                <p>Today, we met with our partner to discuss the latest stage of our prototype. The session focused on
                  clarifying how our system works and why we made certain design choices.
                </p>
                <p>One key question raised was:
                  <br>"Why not just use one sensor on the door where everyone passes through, wouldn't that be cheaper?"
                  <br>We explained that while one sensor could track movement, it would not be able to determine
                  direction. Using a dual sensor setup allows us to identify whether someone is entering or exiting, which is critical for
                  accurate footfall counting, especially in a free-flow space like in the Kibble Palace. It also reduces the risk
                  of miscounting during crowded moments, such as events or school group visits.
                </p>
                <p>Another question was:
                  <br>"How does the system distinguish entry from exit?"
                  <br>We explained that the two sensors would be placed in sequence. If Sensor A triggers before Sensor B,
                  it's logged as an entry. If Sensor B triggers before Sensor A, it's logged as an exit. This simple logic forms the
                  core of our tracking system and is both cost-effective and privacy-respecting.
                </p>
                <p>This discussion helped reinforce the importance of clearly communicating the logic and benefits of our
                  setup. It also confirmed that our solution aligns well with the client's goals, accuracy, simplicity and minimal
                  disruption to the building.

                <h4>Day 11 - Usability Testing and Poster</h4>
                <p>Day 11 marks the submission of our group poster. Today the team finalised the poster together using
                  what was taught during the lecture on poster design during Day 9 conducted by Prof. Alistair. The poster was designed to be
                  visually appealing, informative, and easy to read. We used a clean layout with clear headings, bullet points, and visuals to
                  highlight our key findings and design process.
                  Furthermore, we also made sure to ensure that the mistakes of posters that Prof. Alistair highlighted
                  during the lecture were not repeated in our poster.
                  One such example, is ensuring that the poster is not too wordy and the font size is large enough to be
                  read from a distance.

                  In addition to the poster, we also conducted usability testing on our prototype which can be viewed form
                  the video below. We invited a classmate to interact with our figma prototype and
                  provide feedback on the user experience. The main feedback we received was that the prototype was
                  missing a back button at the end of the form which
                  did not allow the user to go back to the previous page. This was a key insight that we took into account
                  and made sure to implement in our final prototype.
                  the user also pointed out that the use of interesting facts about the Kibble Palace gave them an
                  incentive to scan the QR code form to complete the form.

                <h4>Day 12 - Implementing Usability Feedback</h4>
                <p>Acting on the specific feedback from yesterday's usability testing, today's work centered on refining the navigation of our post-submission "Interesting Facts" feature. Our test user noted that while they could proceed forward to view multiple facts, there was no "Back" button, preventing them from revisiting a previous fact they had already seen.</p>

                <p>To resolve this, we updated the Figma prototype by implementing the missing "Back" button, which now works alongside the existing forward navigation. This addition gives users full control over their post-submission experience, allowing them to freely browse back and forth through the educational content at their leisure.</p>

                <p>A key consideration was to maintain clarity about the form's status. The new "Back" button's functionality is intentionally limited to navigating only between the interesting facts. It does not allow the user to return to the form itself, ensuring that once the form is submitted, the process is clearly complete and preventing any user confusion.</p>

                <h4>Day 13 - Final Deliverables and Project Reflection</h4>
                <p>With the prototyping and testing phases complete, the focus for Day 13 was to consolidate our work and document the journey. The main tasks were to finalize this website and write our comprehensive project reflections, which involved looking back at our process from start to finish.</p>

                <p>Finalising the website meant ensuring every page was polished and cohesive. We populated each section with the relevant text, images, videos, and interactive embeds that we created over the past three weeks. The goal was to create a clear narrative that walks a visitor through our entire design process, from understanding the initial challenge on the homepage to exploring the detailed prototypes and reviewing the final proposal.</p>

                <p>The most significant task was writing our reflections. As a team, we looked back on the key moments of the project. We discussed the critical insights from our first stakeholder meeting regarding heritage constraints, the technical learnings that led us from a single to a dual-sensor system, and how direct feedback from Kibble Palace visitors fundamentally shaped our QR code form and dashboard design. This exercise was crucial for articulating the "why" behind our design decisions. The outcome of this work now forms the content of the 'Reflections' page on this site, bringing our project to a close.</p>
