            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 1 - Stakeholder Meeting</h4>
              <p>For our stakeholder meeting, we met with Chrissy from Friends of Glasgow Bontanic Gardens for insights
                on footfall tracking in the gardens. She explained the daily operational challenges: with staff
                struggling to justify resource allocation without concrete visitor data and a distinct lack of usage
                statistics resulting in weakening funding applications. Through this meeting, we now had an insight on
                the challenges of accurate footfall counting in a listed building with limited budget and strict
                modification rules.</p>
              <p>Key insights from the meeting: Any solution must be invisible to visitors, along with no structural
                modifications to the building. Budget constraints are also a significant factor, as well as ensuring
                that the plants remain unaffected.</p>

            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 2 - Initial Research</h4>
              <p>After the stakeholder meeting, we begun exploring existing solutions and their limitations. An
                extensive brainstorming session was carried out where we explored multiple technical approaches. Some
                suggestions were initially considered, such as thermal imaging or pressure plates, but were rejected
                eventually due to privacy concerns and cost. More advanced solutions were also considered, such as using
                computer vision, but were rejected due to the complexity of implementation and the need for significant
                computational resources.</p>
              <p>We eventually settled on a IR sensor approach, which would be cost-effective and easy to
                install without modifying the building structure. The system would consist of two IR sensors placed at
                the entrance, counting entries and exits while remaining discreet.</p>

            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 3 - Ideation Sketches</h4>
              <p>After designing on our solution, we started out by creating a lo-fi prototype of a IR sensor
                system. During the process, we realised placement and directionality matter more
                than expected, as single sensors would overcount due to multiple people moving back and forth. This led
                to the conclusion that a dual sensor setup would be necessary to accurately count foot traffic. We also
                sketched potential dashboard layouts and discussed data visualization requirements.</p>
              <p> (maybe we can put the sketches here too)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 4 - Client Feedback</h4>
              <p>For day 4, we created a pitch deck and video, documenting out thought process and initial solution. The
                video creation process helped us to articulate our solution clearly, while also helping us identify gaps
                in our reasoning. We also carried out more research on existing sensors and their capabilities, to
                further refine our approach.</p>

            <div class="daily-entry">
              <h4>Day 5 - Dashboard Prototyping</h4>
              <p>We focused on designing the dashboard interface for the staff use. Based on the client meeting and
                understanding of their needs, we prioritized features like real-time visitor counts, daily patterns, and
                historical data visualization. We created wireframes for different dashboard views: real-time occupancy
                display showing current visitor counts, daily summary charts tracking hourly patterns, weekly trend
                analysis for operational planning, and monthly reports suitable for council presentations and funding
                applications. </p>
              <p>We designed the interface to show key metrics at a glance, as well as specialized sections for deeper
                insights: visitor trends showing daily patterns, coutry of origin data, as well as event tracking with
                attendance figures, helping staff to understand which programs drive the most engagement</p>
              <p>At first, there was some struggles with balancing comprehensive data presentation while still retaining
                visual clarity. We eventually settled on a clean, spacious layout with large fonts and intuitive color
                coding, making it easier for staff to digest the information quickly which still providing the detailed
                analytics needed for strategic planning and reporting.</p>

              <h4>Day 6 - Interviewing Visitors of Kibble Palace</h4>
              <p>Today, we visited Kibble Palace to gather feedback from actual visitors about their awareness and thoughts 
                on footfall tracking. Surprisingly, many assumed that there was already a tracking system in place and were 
                unaware that the data was oudated.</p>
              <p>Most visitors were open to the idea of anonymous tracking if it can help improve the management of the place, 
                especially if it preserves the free entry policy. We explained our concept (IR sensors + QR code form) and the feedback 
                we got was posititve provided it remained non-intrusive and didn't feel like surveillance. However, they also highlighted 
                that they would not be incentivised to scan the QR code form as it did not benefit their visit to the Kibble Palace.</p>

              <h4>Day 7 - Improving QR Code Form and Dashboard Prototypes</h4>
              <p>Following the feedback we received from visitors during our interviews at Kibble Palace, we made several improvements to our prototype to enhance user engagement and data utility.</p>
              <p>Based on the interviews we did yesterday, we made serveral improvements to the dashboard and QR code form.</p>
              <p>QR Code Form improvements, many visitors indicated they lacked incentive to complete it. To address this:
                <li>Added a section that displays fun and lesser-known facts about Kibble Palace after submission</li>
              </p>
              <p>On the dashboard side, we integrated new features to make the data more insightful for stakeholders. These includes:
                <li>Added weather impacts to visitor numbers.</li>
                <li>Added events and their respective visitor counts.</li>
                <li>Show weekly and monthly visitor counts.</li>
                <p>These changes were designed to provide clearer, more actionable insights to inform future decisions.</p>
